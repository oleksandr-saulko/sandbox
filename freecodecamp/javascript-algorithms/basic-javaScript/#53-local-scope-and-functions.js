// ❓DESCRIPTION:
// Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.
// Note: The console will still display ReferenceError: myVar is not defined, but this will not cause the tests to fail.

// ✅ SOLUTION:

function myLocalScope() {
  // Only change code below this line
  let myVar;
  console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
}
myLocalScope();

// Run and check the console
// myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);
